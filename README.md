## Implementation

### Frontend
- Developed using React with a component-based architecture.
- Pages include:
  - **Home**: Welcomes users and provides navigation.
  - **Login/Signup**: Secure user authentication.
  - **Consultation Form**: Accepts user symptoms and displays predictions.
  - **Report Page**: Displays detailed health reports.

### Backend
- Built using Flask with RESTful APIs:
  - `/login` and `/signup`: For user authentication.
  - `/predict`: For processing symptoms and returning predictions.
- Integrated Flask-CORS for frontend-backend communication.
- Uses serialized machine learning models for predictions.

### Machine Learning
- Implements multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Symptom encoding and model evaluation based on metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and AUC.
- Trained on curated datasets for medical symptoms and diseases.

### Cloud Deployment
- Deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP):
  - **Google App Engine**: For hosting frontend and backend.
  - **Google Cloud Storage**: For secure data storage.
  - **IAM Roles**: Role-based access for data security.

## System Architecture

MediPredict follows a modular, RESTful architecture for seamless interaction between components. Key workflows include:
1. **Symptom Submission**: User inputs symptoms on the frontend.
2. **Backend Processing**: Inputs are validated and processed by ML models.
3. **Prediction Generation**: The best model predicts the disease and queries datasets for recommendations.
4. **Report Delivery**: Results are returned as structured JSON and displayed to users.
